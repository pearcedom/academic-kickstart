# Biography

Final year PhD student at the University of Edinburgh's Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, working in the Applied Bioinformatics of Cancer research group. 

## Research
Manipulation of large molecular datasets in an attempt to characterise patient-derived tumour material and its relationship with response to treatment and prognosis. By better stratifying patients based on their molecular characteristics we hope to achieve a two-fold benefit in i) correctly assigning treatment to patients and ii) avoiding unnecessary overtreatment.

## Background
From 2007-2012 I studied biochemistry and cancer biology, completing research projects investigating the role of JAK-STAT signalling in cancer as well as exploring the potential for low-dose doxorubicin treatment for breast cancer. I have studied in the applied bioinformatics of cancer group since 2014 publishing twice, and am currently in the process of submitting my thesis. Beyond science I have several years experience as a chef in Lyon, France.
